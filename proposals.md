# Quonauts 7 — Proposals

<a name='1'/>

## #1

Append to rule 5.4 "Editing proposals":

> The author of a proposal, or the player passing the proposal may choose to add or remove whitespace and fix typos or grammar mistakes as needed so long as the meaning of the proposal remains unchanged. Clarifications or additional details should always be added a new proposal.

(stolen from Lukalot in Quonauts 6, I'd meant to put that in initial)

## #2

Add a new quantity, called "Ducks".
Ducks are earned every 5 proposals from the author of the proposals passing.
Each duck earned adds the number of ducks to the points earned from a proposal, effectively increasing your points. 
Along with this, append to rule 6. "Quantities" ( %quantities)
> **• Duck:**  Ducks are earned every 5 proposals passing from the proposal author, and they increase the amount of points earned from a proposal by the amount of ducks the author has.
