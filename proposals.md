## #1 ‚Äî Passed

Append to rule 5.4 "Editing proposals":

> The author of a proposal, or the player passing the proposal may choose to add or remove whitespace and fix typos or grammar mistakes as needed so long as the meaning of the proposal remains unchanged. Clarifications or additional details should always be added a new proposal.

(stolen from Lukalot in Quonauts 6, I'd meant to put that in initial)

## #2

Add a new quantity, called "Ducks".
Ducks are earned every 5 proposals from the author of the proposals passing.
Each duck earned adds the number of ducks to the points earned from a proposal, effectively increasing your points. 
Along with this, append to rule 6. "Quantities" ( %quantities)
> **‚Ä¢ Ducks:**  Each duck earned adds the number of ducks to the points earned from a proposal.
aswell as that, add rule 6.1 "Ducks" (%ducks)
> Ducks are earned every 5 proposals passing from the proposal author, and they increase the amount of points earned from a proposal by the amount of ducks the author has.

Nobles can react to an Open Proposal authored by a Peasant with a üî• to Fail and Close that Proposal. Peasants cannot vote üëé on an Open Proposal authored by a Noble.

## #6

Add a new rule (%land);
> The Land is an infinite square lattice. A 'land tile' is a point of this lattice, and has corresponding coordinates and a type (number associated with a string). Every pair of integer coordinates has a corresponding land tile.
> 'land-x' and 'land-y' are quantities. A player with (land-x, land-y) matching the coordinates of a certain land tile 'resides' in that land tile.
add a rule under %land (%land-movement);
> Subject to a 12-hour cooldown, a player may add or subtract 1 from one of their coordinates.
and add another rule under %land (%land-generation).
> By default, a land tile has type 'empty', or 0. A land tile with type 0 and a player residing in it changes its type to 'grass', or 1.
