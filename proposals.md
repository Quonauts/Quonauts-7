## #1 ‚Äî Passed

Append to rule 5.4 "Editing proposals":

(stolen from Lukalot in Quonauts 6, I'd meant to put that in initial)

Ducks are earned every 5 proposals from the author of the proposals passing.

Along with this, append to rule 6. "Quantities" ( %quantities)
> **‚Ä¢ Ducks:**  Each duck earned adds the number of ducks to the points earned from a proposal.
aswell as that, add rule 6.1 "Ducks" (%ducks)
> Ducks are earned every 5 proposals passing from the proposal author, and they increase the amount of points earned from a proposal by the amount of ducks the author has.

## #6 ‚Äî Passed

Add a new rule (%land);
> The Land is an infinite square lattice. A 'land tile' is a point of this lattice, and has corresponding coordinates and a type (number associated with a string). Every pair of integer coordinates has a corresponding land tile.

add a rule under %land (%land-movement);
> Subject to a 12-hour cooldown, a player may add or subtract 1 from one of their coordinates.
and add another rule under %land (%land-generation).

## #9 ‚Äî Failed

This proposal depends on #2.

Append to rule 6 "Quantities":
> * **Point**

Append to rule 5.3.1 "Passing and failing proposals":
> If a proposal passes, the author and the player who passed it gain one point. The author also gains points equal to their number of ducks.

<a name='10'/>

## #10 ‚Äî Failed

Add a new rule: %monarch
> One player carries the title of "Monarch" (or "King" or "Queen", if preferred), chosen by election (see %royal-election). The monarch's vote on a proposal counts twice. If the monarch becomes inactive or one of their proposals fails, they are forced to either pass on their title voluntarily or abdicate, which means they immediately loses this title of monarch and a new election happens to elect a new king. The monarch may pass on their title to another active player voluntarily any time.
Add a subrule %royal-election:
> A new king is chosen by poll, with all active players as candidates (unless they explicitly declare not to candidate). The conditions for ending the election are similar to proposals:
> * 48 hours have passed since start of the poll
> * all active players have cast a vote
> * one candidate has gained an absolute majority of votes
> If one of these occur, the election is immediately over and no more votes may be cast in the poll. If then one player has the most votes, they become the new monarch. Otherwise, a new election begins.
When this proposal passes, immediately start the first royal election.

Replace %the-end with:

> * all active players have cast a vote
> * one candidate has gained an absolute majority of votes
