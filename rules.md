## <a name='meta-rules'/> Meta rules

This section details how the rules are to be applied to the game.

### <a name='accuracy'/> Accuracy

This document is not guaranteed to always be up-to-date as the game rules are modified, however it is the duty of all players to keep this document accurate as game rules are modified. Where this document disagrees with the game rules, players must follow the game rules as they legally are, rather than their description in this document.

### <a name='precedence'/> Precedence

In the case of a contradiction between clauses, the following criteria are to be considered in turn until a clear determination can be made as to which clause takes precedence:

1. If one clause has a more limited scope than another, then the clause with the more limited scope takes precedence.
2. If one clause is negative while the other is positive, then the negative clause takes precedence.
3. The clause which appears last in the rules takes precedence.

### <a name='disallowed-by-default'/> Disallowed by default

Unless explicitly stated in the rules, all game actions are forbidden.

### <a name='rule-violations'/> Rule violations

A rule violation is a game action that is not permitted by the rules. Resolving a rule violation is the process of reversing the immediate effects of that rule violation (not including any indirect effects permitted in reaction to the rule violation) to the extent that it is possible.

#### <a name='errors'/> Errors

An error is a rule violation made by a player either mistakenly or through ignorance. If a player causes a rule violation and is able to resolve the error, they may do so.

If a player resolves an error within 24 hours of making that error, and the resolution of the error leaves the game state in such fashion that it is as if the error had never occurred, no punitive action can be taken against the player.

#### <a name='rule-violation-polls'/> Rule violation polls

If any player (hereby "the accusing player") believes that another player (hereby "the accused player") has violated the rules, then the accusing player may conduct a poll (called a "rule violation poll") to determine whether the accused player has violated the rules.

In conducting a rule violation poll, the accusing player must describe which sections or clauses of the rules were violated and what illegal game action was taken by the accused player. Players should vote in favor of this poll only if they agree that the accused player violated the rules as described.

Any vote in such a poll cast by the accused player is not counted.

A rule violation poll must be available for voting for at least 24 hours before any action may be taken as a result.

A rule violation poll may not be started more than 7 days after the potential rule violation.

For any potential rule violation, only one rule violation poll may be conducted.

If a rule violation poll passes, then the accused player is now convicted of violating the rules as described in the poll and the rule violation must be resolved, if it has not already.

#### <a name='punitive-action'/> Punitive action

If a player (hereby "the convicted player") is convicted of violating the rules, another player may conduct a poll (called a "punitive action poll") to determine whether punitive action should be taken.

Players should vote in favour of this poll only if they believe the convicted player violated the rules knowingly and with malicious intent.

Any vote in such a poll cast by the convicted player is not counted.

A punitive action poll must be available for voting for at least 24 hours before any action may be taken as a result.

If a punitive action poll passes, then the convicted player gains one strike.

### <a name='timezones'/> Timezones

Unless otherwise specified, all times and dates are specified with respect to UTC.
